# ResumeScreening-NLP
Companies often receive thousands of resumes for each job posting and employ dedicated screening officers to screen qualified candidates. In this article, I will introduce you to a NLP project on Resume Screening with Python programming language.

IT departments are short of growing markets. In a typical service organization, professionals with a variety of technical skills and business domain expertise are hired and assigned to projects to resolve customer issues. This task of selecting the best talent among many others is known as Resume Screening.

Typically, large companies do not have enough time to open each CV, so they use machine learning algorithms for the Resume Screening task.
So this is how we can train a Machine Learning model for the task of Resume Screening.
